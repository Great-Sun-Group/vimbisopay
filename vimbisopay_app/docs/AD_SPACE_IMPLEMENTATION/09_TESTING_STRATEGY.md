# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the VimbisoPay app, detailing our approach to ensuring code quality and reliability through comprehensive testing.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Repository Tests**
  - Test API interactions and data mapping
  - Verify error handling for network failures
  - Mock HTTP responses for consistent testing
  - Coverage includes:
    - Login functionality
    - Credex operations (create, cancel, accept)
    - Notification token registration
    - Ledger data retrieval

- **BLoC Tests**
  - Test state management and business logic
  - Verify correct state transitions
  - Test error handling and recovery
  - Coverage includes:
    - Initial states
    - Complex state sequences
    - Error states
    - Async operations
    - Data refresh flows

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test interaction between different layers
- Verify data flow from UI through BLoC to Repository
- Test database operations and caching

### 3. Widget Tests
- Test UI components in isolation
- Verify widget behavior and user interactions
- Test screen layouts and responsiveness

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. State Management Testing
- Use `emitsInOrder` for testing complex state sequences
- Verify intermediate states during operations
- Test timeout scenarios
- Mock dependencies for consistent results

### 2. Repository Testing
- Mock HTTP responses for both success and failure cases
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Verify correct data mapping between API and domain models

### 3. Error Handling
- Test all error scenarios
- Verify error messages and user feedback
- Test recovery from error states

## Test Organization
- Tests mirror the source code structure
- Clear naming conventions for test files and cases
- Group related tests for better organization
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

## Tools and Libraries
- **Testing Framework**: Flutter Test
- **Mocking**: Mocktail
- **State Management Testing**: bloc_test
- **Network Mocking**: Mock HTTP client

## Continuous Integration
- All tests run on every pull request
- Required passing tests before merge
- Coverage reports generated automatically

## Recent Improvements
- Enhanced BLoC testing with proper state transition verification
- Improved error case coverage in repository tests
- Removed legacy widget tests
- Added comprehensive testing for Credex operations
- Implemented proper timeout handling in async tests
